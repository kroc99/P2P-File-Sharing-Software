# P2P-File-Sharing-Software
Similar to BitTorrent

For this project we worked collaboratively on creating a peer to peer file sharing system dedicated to sharing a file within certain peers and preferred neighbors. This is done with simmilar functions and types as BitTorrent like choke, unchoke, interested, not interested, have, and request. We have all of the messages saved within a log file for all the peers that gets created upon the opening of the socket and have printed out a few checks in our terminal to verify variable updates and bitfield translations.
